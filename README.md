# Airbnb clone

This project is one that I worked on for about 2 months. It's a completed Airbnb clone that features many of the actual website's features such as user authentication, user pages, listings, reviews, and booking (without actual payments, of course), to name a few.

## Technologies & Tools

The project was built using the React framework using the following technologies and tools:
* Next.js
* JavaScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Firebase
* Google Maps API
* Vercel (for deployment)

Note: I originally worked on the project in a different repo, but made a new one without the API keys so that I can make it public.
